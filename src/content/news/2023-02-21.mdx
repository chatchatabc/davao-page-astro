The city government of Davao has announced that they will be conducting a simulation exercise (Simex) in February 2023. This exercise will be designed to test the response of the safety and security cluster against possible terrorist attacks. The Simex aims to evaluate the muscle memory of the authorities and determine their readiness to respond to emergency situations.

The city government has reminded the public to expect heavy traffic on the day of the Simex and to cooperate with the authorities during the exercise. The Simex will be a city-wide activity that might occur anytime this month. The government has urged everyone to remain calm and to understand the possible scenarios and what to expect during the exercise. The public's cooperation and support are crucial to the success of the Simex in improving the city's security.

In a separate interview with SunStar Davao on February 20, 2023, Colonel Darren Comia, Task Force Davao head, stated that they would not be releasing the complete details of the Simex. The authorities are limiting the release of information to maintain the exercise's effectiveness and avoid compromising its objectives. Colonel Comia has emphasized that terrorists may attack anytime and anywhere, and this activity aims to test the safety and security cluster's response to emergency situations.

The Task Force Davao head has also acknowledged the gaps and lapses identified during the previous Simex conducted in the city. Communication was one of the major concerns, and the authorities are currently addressing these gaps through continuous communication exercises with different units. Colonel Comia has expressed confidence that the Simex this year would be smoother than the previous one.

Finally, Colonel Comia has encouraged Dabawenyos to cooperate with the authorities during the Simex. The support and cooperation of the public are essential to maintaining the peace, security, and order in Davao City. The authorities aim to improve the city's security by conducting regular security drills, identifying gaps and lapses, and continuously addressing these concerns. With the cooperation of the public and the authorities' readiness, Davao City aims to remain a safe and secure place for everyone.
