With the ongoing investigation of the killing of the 38-year-old, businesswoman, Yvonne Chua, alliance group Gabriela urged authorities for a neutral investigation claiming that a brigade commander may have been allegedly involved in the incident.

“Gabriela calls for thorough and neutral investigation into the heinous killing of Yvonne Plaza Chua, fearing that it could be whitewashed after the news on social media identified Brigade Commander General Jess Durante of Davao was involved in her murder,” Gabriela said in an emailed statement to the media.

Gabriella added that the family of Chua must also be protected as they have been releasing evidence of the alleged suspect of the murder.

Following the death of Chua, an alleged post of her on Facebook circulated online showing photos of her injured face and body. It is here where she allegedly claimed that Durante was the cause of her injuries.

Durante was former President Duterte’s close-in security and was part of the Presidential Security Group (PSG).

Gabriela said they are open to all the victims of violence against women for help.

“Bukas ang pinto ng Gabriela sa pamilya at mga kaibigan ni Ms. Chua kung nais nilang idulog ang kaso nito (We are open to assist the family of Ms. Chua if they want to push this case),” Gabriela Secretary General Clarice Palce said in their press release.

Palce added that they are calling for justice and fairness with the special investigation task group (SITG) that was created to investigate the case.

“Nakikiramay ang Gabriela sa pamilya at mga kaibigan ni Ms. Yvonne Chua. Kailangan ang mabusisi at patas na imbestigasyon sa kaso lalo na’t isang mataas na opisyal ng gobyerno ang nasasangkot (We extend our condolences to the family of Ms. Yvonne Chua. We are hoping that this case will be investigated fairly especially that a high official from the government was involved),” Palce said. KSD
